Understanding the molecular mechanisms of congenital diseases is challenging due to their occurrence within specific developmental stages. Esophageal malformations are examples of such conditions, characterized by abnormalities in the development of esophagus during embryogenesis. These developmental malformations encompass a range of anomalies, including esophageal atresia, and tracheoesophageal fistula. Here, we investigated the preferential expression of 29 genes that are implicated in such malformations and their immediate interactome (a total of 67 genes) in several single-cell atlas of embryonic development. We conducted our analyses using several single-cell atlases of embryonic development, encompassing approximately 150,000 cells from the mouse foregut, around 180,000 cells from human embryos, and approximately 500,000 cells from 24 human organs. Our study, spanning diverse mesodermal and endodermal cell populations and early developmental stages, shows that the genes associated with esophageal malformations show their highest cell-type specific expression in lateral plate mesoderm cells and at the developmental stage of E8.75-E9.0 days. In human embryos, these genes show a significant cell-type specific expression among subpopulations of epithelial cells, fibroblasts and progenitor cells including basal cells. Notably, members of the forkhead-box family of transcription factors, namely FOXF1, FOXC1, and FOXD1, as well as the SRY-box transcription factor, SOX2, demonstrate the most significant preferential expression in both mouse and human embryos. Overall, our findings provide insights into the temporal and cellular contexts contributing to esophageal malformations.
